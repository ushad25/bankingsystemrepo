description about banking system
This code is a simple banking system implemented in Python. Let's go through it step by step:

Import Random Module:import random
This line imports the random module, which is used later to generate a random account number.
Initialize an Empty Dictionary for Accounts:accounts = {}
This dictionary will store information about each account. The account number will be the key, and the associated values will be a dictionary containing the account holder's name and balance.
Create Account Function:This function prompts the user to enter their name and initial balance. It generates a random account number and creates a new entry in the accounts dictionary with this information.
Login Function:This function allows a user to log in by entering their account number. If the account number exists in the accounts dictionary, it prints a welcome message; otherwise, it prompts the user to try again.
Deposit Function:This function allows a logged-in user to deposit money into their account. It prompts the user to enter the deposit amount and updates the account balance accordingly.
Withdraw Function:Similar to the deposit function, this function allows a logged-in user to withdraw money from their account, provided the withdrawal amount is valid and there is enough balance.
Main Program (Menu):The main program runs an infinite loop that displays a menu of options for the user to choose from.
Menu Options:

The menu options include:
Create Account (Choice 1): Calls the create_account function.
Login (Choice 2): Calls the login function and, if successful, displays a sub-menu for account-related actions.
Deposit (Choice 3): Prints a message to login first.
Withdraw (Choice 4): Prints a message to login first.
Exit (Choice 5): Exits the program.
Account Menu:

If the user successfully logs in, a sub-menu is displayed with options for depositing, withdrawing, and logging out.
Exiting the Program:

Choosing "5" from the main menu breaks out of the infinite loop, effectively exiting the program.
This code provides a basic structure for a banking system with account creation, login, and transaction functionalities. It uses simple input/output interactions to communicate with the user.
