# SimpleBankingSystem

## Description
SimpleBankingSystem is a basic banking application implemented in Python. Developed by Usha under the guidance of mentor Jisma, and using the Entry platform, this project demonstrates fundamental banking operations such as account creation, user authentication, deposits, and withdrawals. The application features a command-line interface designed for clarity and ease of use.

## Features

### Account Creation
- Users can create a new bank account by providing their name and an initial deposit amount.
- A unique random account number is generated for each new account.

### User Login
- Users can log in to their accounts by entering their account number.
- The system verifies the account number and grants access to account functions if valid.

### Deposits
- Logged-in users can deposit money into their accounts.
- The system updates the account balance accordingly.

### Withdrawals
- Logged-in users can withdraw funds from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance.
- The system ensures that the withdrawal amount is valid before processing.

### User-Friendly Menu
- The main program features a menu-driven interface, allowing users to easily navigate through different banking operations.
- A sub-menu is available after logging in, providing options for account-specific actions such as deposits and withdrawals.

## How It Works

### Main Menu
1. **Create Account**
2. **Login** (with options to Deposit, Withdraw, or Logout)
3. **Exit**

### Account Management
- Once logged in, users can perform transactions like depositing or withdrawing money.

### Exiting the Program
- The program runs in an infinite loop, allowing users to perform multiple operations. Choosing the "Exit" option terminates the program.

This project serves as a foundational example for understanding basic banking operations in Python, with a focus on simplicity and clarity.
